                <p class="biography-information">My name is Sebastian Gomez Nohava. I was born on august 19 of 1999 in Medellín, Colombia.
                    My whole life is a continuos pursuit of new stages to increase my knowledge. Arts and math have been an important part of my life; I can remember be at high school and always looking for new environments where I can use both of them, and enhannce everyday.
                    I just graduated from the ITM (Metropolitan Techological Institute) in Medellin, Colombia as a producer; but looking back in time, I have always been interested in how innovation and creations can help world to improve and change lifes. That's the reason why, at my 25 years old, I'm looking to start a new career in La Salle University to become a Software Engineer.
                    Being part of the forefront in techological evolution, AI, and new options for the world is where I thrive and I always strive to be updated in all environments.
                    This history continues...

                    Why should you go through this website?
                </summary>
                This is part of the initial portfolio I started to built a few week ago. Part of my plan is bring everything I can to the innovation, including myself and everything regarding my professional life.

                    Where this idea came from?
                </summary>
                I have been checking programming world since I started around January 2024. I was completely amused by how this world everyday is changing. Nowadays, being on the forefront of the technological innovation should be the dream for evertbody. Never have seen something like this, a website that walk you through someone's life as a curriculum and a portfolio together?

                    Why the tab name is "a new beginning?"
                </summary>
                I have been working on my programming since January 2024, but everytime I have to do something I was working to get it done and throw it away. So now, this is the new beginning where I am going to strive myself beyond the 100% to find my buzz.

                    Is programming what I've been waiting for?
                </summary>
                I wouldn't say that; programming is just a place or action where I thrive, for my passion, my faster learner skill, and last but not least, always knowledge hungry.
